# VPL Theory CCP 

**VPL Theory CCP** is an academic project focused on demonstrating **core concepts of Computer & Concurrent Programming (CCP)** through theory-based implementations and structured documentation. The project is designed to support learning, experimentation, and understanding of theoretical programming constructs commonly taught in university-level courses.

---

##  Project Overview

This repository contains structured material and practical examples related to **VPL (Virtual Programming Lab) Theory for CCP**. It serves as a reference project for students to understand theoretical concepts, experiment with sample code, and prepare for lab assessments or coursework submissions.

The project is suitable for:

* CCP / Operating Systems courses
* Parallel & Concurrent Programming fundamentals
* University VPL theory submissions

---

##  Tech Stack / Tools

* **Language:** C / C++ (theory-oriented examples)
* **Platform:** Virtual Programming Lab (VPL)
* **IDE/Compiler:** GCC / Online VPL environment
* **Operating System:** Linux-based (VPL compatible)
